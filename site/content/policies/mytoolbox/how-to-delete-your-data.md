### Preamble

This document shows you how to delete your data at any given time.

### 1. Deleting your data

As there is no copy of your data on our servers, you can simlpy delete your data from the application manually. You can also directly remove the app from your device and all the data will be deleted. Careful though, if you decided to share your username(s) with us, please delete them first before deleting the app. You can see how to do so in the second point.

### 2. Deleting your username(s) from our server

If you decide not to share your username anymore with us, simply delete your username(s) into the applicationâ€™s settings. This action will automatically perform a delation of his data on our server.
